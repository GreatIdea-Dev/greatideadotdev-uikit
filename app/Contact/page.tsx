        &ldquo;You&apos;ll need to drink all of this. Harry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&apos;s a
        potion for dreamless sleep.&rdquo; Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt
        himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the
        hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his
        bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress.
        Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had
        carried him off to sleep. Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn&apos;t open
        his eyes, wanting to drop off again.

        &ldquo;Padma&apos;s going to meet you in the entrance hall,&rdquo; she added to Ron.
        &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Ron, looking around. &ldquo;Where&apos;s Hermione?&rdquo; Parvati
        shrugged. &ldquo;Shall we go down then, Harry?&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said Harry,
        wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the
        way out of the portrait hole.
